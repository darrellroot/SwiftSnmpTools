#  SwiftSnmpTools

A set of SNMP command-line tools implemented in Swift and intended as a test/demonstration project for SwiftSnmpKit https://github.com/darrellroot/SwiftSnmpKit

## Performance

The swift-crypto library performs _much_ faster when built for release rather than debug.  The easiest way to do this while testing in Xcode is to "Build for profiling"
